I made this game for fun because why not and it's good practice while learning in C#.

It's based on the classic Snake game made in the early 1980s where the objective is to navigate the snake around the screen collecting the food without hitting the wall or the snake's own tail. Also every time the snake eats the food it's size increases which is to be expected with the amount of food it eats.
